          Bender, this is Fry's decisionâ€¦ and he made it wrong. So it's time for
          us to interfere in his life. When I was first asked to make a film
          about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then
          later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there
          would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! And then
          the battle's not so bad? Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die
          like this. But I always really hoped. Fetal stemcells, aren't those
          controversial? Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.
